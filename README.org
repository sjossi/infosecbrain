** Description
Since I can't remember all the things that I read online and all the links that I get I need an external brain. Usually they go in whatever task-manager or notepad I have open at the time, but that's not manageable or helpful anymore. It's mostly infosec-related, so maybe someone else can use it.

* Resources
** Dump
	Just copy-pasted from all the different sources that I used to dump links in.
